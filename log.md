### Day 0: April 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started a personal project to improve JS skills.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled starting this challenge, but overall I think this will be a great adventure.


### Day 1: April 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Coding the basics: HTML and CSS of the Health Care Site.

**Thoughts:** The project is starting to get its form and I'm anxious to code the scrip.js.

### Day 2: April 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Installed Jquery and setted changes at the date input.

**Thoughts:** I'm trying to improve my jquery skills and planning the API's i'll use in this project (probably it'll be REST)
